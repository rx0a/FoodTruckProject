# Overview
A food truck review program that allows the user to enter food truck names, types and rating for up to 5 food trucks. The user then can view the existing food truck information in a list, see the average of ratings, or the highest rated one. Each truck also has its own unique ID.

# Technologies Used
- Java
- Object initialization
- Visibility
- Arrays
- Looping
- Encapsulation

# How to Run
The user is first prompted to enter the food truck information. Typing "quit" for food truck name, allows the user to switch to the main menu.

# Lessons Learned
This project involved practicing fundamentals of Java as well as other minor unexpected learning experiences. One such example is the use of Scanner's .useDelimiter function to allow users to input food truck names that has spaces in them to be recorded and accessed without any issues.
